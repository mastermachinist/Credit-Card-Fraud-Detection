# Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions Classification


#Discussion -
The Banking and Finance Industry uses Data Science and Machine Learning for various use cases such as Detection of Fraudulent Transactions , Customer Lifetime Value Predictions , Risk Modelling , Personalised Marketing and several others.
we shall create Machine Learning Models that solve the essential and complex problem of Fraud Detection in Transactions to empower the Industry with Real-Time Classification of Fraud.Latest Machine Learning Techniques can help to solve this problem with a decent level of accuracy and in a very short time span.

#Plan of Action -
Let's structure and Plan the Methodology to go about solving this problem -

Brainstorming on why this problem MUST BE SOLVED and the impact of a great solution to the Industry

Understading the Data , Exploring it's length , breadth and height ( How BIG , How DIVERSE , How GRANULAR ) Called : EDA

Visualisation of Data for Finding any specific Pattern or Flaw in the Data that can effect the Model

Finding the Complexities and Roadblocks for Modelling this particular Use Case

Solving Use Case Specific Problems and consequently Handling Errors , Outliers and Missing Values in the Data

Processing and Cleaning the Data to make it fit for Modelling and feeding to a Machine Learning Model

Splitting the Dataset into Training and Testing Datasets

Training the data on Multiple Classification Models

Evaluating Models based on various Metrics and Understanding which metric is the most appropriate for Model Evaluation

Lastly , disucssion on further ways to improve the model , feedback mechanism for the model and saving the model for future use
